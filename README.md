# Spam Classifier using SMS Spam Collection Dataset

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a spam classifier that distinguishes between spam and ham (non-spam) SMS messages using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. The classifier is built using various machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

-   Implement a spam classification model using text messages.
-   Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
-   Understand the impact of feature extraction techniques on model accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as either "spam" or "ham". The dataset consists of 5,574 messages, with the following distribution:

-   **Ham**: 4,825 messages
-   **Spam**: 747 messages

### Sample Data

```plaintext
