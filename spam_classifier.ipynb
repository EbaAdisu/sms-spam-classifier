    "# SMS Spam Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). Using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, we will explore various preprocessing techniques, extract relevant features, and implement classification algorithms to accurately detect spam messages. This classifier can help reduce unwanted messages and improve communication efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to:\n",
    "- Preprocess the SMS data for effective feature extraction.\n",
    "- Train machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's performance in identifying spam messages.\n",
    "- Optimize the classifier to achieve high accuracy and low false-positive rates.\n"
